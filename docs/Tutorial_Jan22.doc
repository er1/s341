- estimation graded on realistic aspect of estimation
- work breakdown structure (wbs): decomposition of each task of overall project
- use clear numbering system 
- 100% rule = everything to be included in the project must be included in the wbs
- this rule is recursive in that each level should be 100% represented of all the taks that make up that level
- should be planning schedule according to work to be done, not how it will be accomplished
- estimating available resources - be realistic - how much time can each member put into it
- limit the size of project - quality over quantity
- over-scoping will cost more than a limited program
- gantt chart is expected
- risk - ability to complete tasks & priority of tasks in relation to other tasks
- use case model 
	- system boundary contains everything system does
	- everyone that acts on the system is outside this boundary
	- can have inheritence in UCM diagram
- domain model	
	- start with noun analysis
	- domain level objects : concepts used to build system
		- 2 parts: name & varibales it needs
	- DLO associations contain a name (action - phrased as verb) and a connecting line between two DLOs
	- multiplicities should be included in DLO associations (how one DLO maps to another - one-to-many, many-to-one, one, many
- tracing requirements: use case numbers should correspond to all those artifacts produced in respect of the use case
	- SSDs, contracts, SDs
