FIG# shows the system sequence diagram for UC11 (Generate Schedule (advanced)). The user activated the "Generate Schedules" feature causing the application to: query the database for the students sequence, determine the courses the student must take next, query the database for the time of those courses, generate all possible schedules that have those courses and return those schedules to the user. The user may make modifications to the suggested list of courses as often as disired causing the database to find the times of new courses (if any) and return a list of newly generated schedules. The user then selects one and confirms it. The confirmation is sent to the system which then attempts the registration and records it in the database. The databse returns the the summary of all registrations (and failiures if any) and the application returns the summary to the user.
