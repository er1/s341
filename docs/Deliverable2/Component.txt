The above component diagram illustrates how the components of Planzilla connect together. Starting at the top, the user provides page requests and or course information / selection and receives markup in return. The interface provides the user with markup while providing and receiving filter data, requests, and markup from the core of the javascript application. The application component of the front end is mainly composed of the core which provides to and receives data from the interface as well as the back end. All but one of the components of the back end either interact with the core of front end and/or provide queries to and receive records from the database. The one exception is the authentication component which must receive log in credentials from the user.
