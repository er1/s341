Wednesday Jan 13, 2010

﻿- using ArgoUML for UML diagrams – java based app
- requirements:
	- login, logout
	- view schedule
	- browse courses
	- create a list of suggested course options
	- view the sequence of courses to follow
	- next suggested courses
	- academic recordsx
- possible options:
	- choosing tec elec with combobox
- sequence planner
	- generate all possibilites
	- be able to select courses from sequence
- populate database on our own
- can use library

---------

Friday Jan 15, 2010


- Scope
- Modules & diagrams
- database diagrams : ERI
- entity-relationship model : SEB & MATT
- Archetecture diagram : how the modules are connected

- Authentication module: login/logout - CORE & ANDREAS
- Presentation module: renders the schedule - jquery, AJAX - shouldn't access database at all - scheduling passes data directly to presentation - MATT & JULIA
- Scheduling module: checks for conflicts/constraints - MySQL - ERI, MATT, JULIA
- Registration module: save function - ANDREAS
- Student record module: talk to db independently from presentation/scheduling - SEB
- Course module: list of all courses - JB
	- Sequence sub-module: list of connections between courses & when their offered
- Database module: give module general query and returns specific query - SEB

Wednesday Jan 20, 2010

- decided on three tier architecture

- Presentation module: 
	- caldenar
		- research 5 hours
		- implementation 20 hours
		- documentation 5 hours
	- style
		- 10 hours
	- tabs
		- each tab 25 hours
- Schedule module:
	- constraints
	- scheduler
	- suggest courses
	- (makes call to dependency validation)
	- 40 hours total
		- starts with large matrix, then remove
- Registration module:
	- temporary save
	- permenant save
	- (makes call to dependency validation)
	- 30 hours
- Course module:
	- sequence list (dependencies)
		- 40 hours
		- just retrieve main sequence
		- retrieve sequence based on record
	- view all courses
	- dependency validation
		- 40 hours
	- course description
- Student Record:
	- transcript module
		- student id, grades, courses, major, minor, age program, entry year, login name
		- 30 hours (a lot of database)
		- design: 15 hours
		- implentation: rest
- Authentication module:
	- 1 week for core
	- 20 hours
	- design/planning/readjusting: 6-8 hours
	- implentation/testing: rest
- Database construction:
	- 100 hours
	- populating database will be time consuming

Next Meetings topic:
- Goals & Constraints
- Scope
- Resource Evaluation

-----------------

Mon Jan 25, 2010

- Introduction - Julia
- Project Description - Andreas
- Goal & Constraints - Matt & Julia
- Resource Evaluation - Eri (4.1), MA (4.2)
- Scoping - JB
- Solution Sketch - MA (6.1), Eri (6.2)
- Plan - JB, Corey, Seb, Andreas

- First draft due Friday Jan 29
- Final drafts due Wed Feb 3 to Julia for proof-reading

- UML diagram
	- Sequence planar: connects to academic record & courses
	- Front-end portion

----------------

Fri Jan 29, 2010

- use cases: added open app & made browse course list public
- CORE: login, generate schedule
	- can be scoped out: history log, browse course list, sequence, 1st tier academic record
- plan: see table
- everything scoped in needs to be included in estimate

----------------

Wed Feb 3, 2010

- project description half done
- domain model needs to be done - JB
- constraints & qualities done
- use cases done
- use case diagram needs to be completed
- human resources - take a look and modify it if you want to
- technical resources & technologies in use located in Development_Environment_and_Resources.doc; missing ui languages/libraries
- scoping done
- architcture = software design doc
- activites & artifacts & project estimates & activites assignments = tables
- schedule = gantt chart
